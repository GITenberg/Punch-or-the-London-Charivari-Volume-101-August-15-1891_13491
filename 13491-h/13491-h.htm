    <h2>LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY.</h2>

    <p><i>Thursday, June 12</i>.&mdash;Letters from Billsbury
    arrive by every post, Horticultural Societies, sea-side
    excursions, Sunday School pic-nics, cricket club <i>fêtes</i>,
    all demand subscriptions, and, as a rule, get them. If this
    goes on much longer I shall be wound up in the Bankruptcy
    Court. Shall have to make a stand soon, but how to begin is the
    difficulty. Pretty certain in any case to put my foot down in
    the wrong place, and offend everybody. Amongst other letters
    came this one:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>4, Stone Street, Billsbury, June 10.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:32%;">
        <a href="images/73-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/73-2.png"
             alt="'I will give any security you like.'" /></a>"I
             will give any security you like."
    </div>

    <p>Sir,&mdash;I venture to appeal to your generosity in a
    matter which I am sure you will recognise to be of the highest
    importance. My services to the Conservative Party in Billsbury
    are well-known. I can safely say that no man has, during the
    last ten years, worked harder than I have to promote
    Conservative interests, and for a smaller reward. My exertions
    at the last election brought on a violent attack of malarial
    fever, which laid me up for some months, and from which I still
    suffer. The shaky character of my hand-writing attests the
    sufferings I have gone through, and the shattered condition of
    my bodily health at the present moment. I lost my situation as
    head-clerk in the Export Department of the Ironmongers'
    Association, and found myself, at the age of forty, compelled
    to begin life again with a wife and three children. Everything
    I have turned my hand to has failed, and I am in dire want. May
    I ask you, under these circumstances, to be so good as to
    advance me £500 for a few months. I will give any security you
    like. Perhaps I might repay some part of the loan by doing work
    for you during the election. This must be a small matter to a
    wealthy and generous man like you. To me it is a matter of life
    and death. Anxiously awaiting your early and favourable reply,
    and begging you to keep this application a secret,</p>

    <p class="author">I remain, Sir, Yours, faithfully, HENRY
    PIDGIN.</p>

    <p>That sounded heart-breaking, but I happened to know that Mr.
    PIDGIN's "malarial fever" was nothing but <i>delirium
    tremens</i>, brought on by a prolonged course of drunkenness.
    Hence his shaky handwriting, &amp;c. BLISSOP had warned me
    against him. Wrote back that, in view of the Corrupt Practices
    Act, it was impossible for me to relieve individual cases.</p>

    <p>Called on the PENFOLDS this afternoon. They are up from
    Billsbury for their stay in London, and have got a house in
    Eaton Square. To my surprise found Mrs. BELLAMY and MARY there.
    That was awkward, especially as MARY looked at me, as I
    thought, very meaningly, and asked me if I didn't think SOPHY
    PENFOLD sweetly pretty. I muttered something about preferring a
    darker type of beauty (MARY's hair is as black as my hat), to
    which MARY replied that perhaps, after all, that kind of pink
    and white beauty with hair like tow <i>was</i> rather insipid.
    The BELLAMYS it seems met the PENFOLDS at a dinner last week,
    and the girls struck up a friendship, this call being the
    result. Young PENFOLD, whom I had never seen before, was there
    and was infernally attentive to MARY. He's in the 24th Lancers,
    and looks like a barber's block. Mrs. BELLAMY said to me, "I've
    been hearing so much about you from dear Lady PENFOLD. They all
    have the highest opinion of you. In fact, Lady PENFOLD said she
    felt quite like a mother to you. And how kind of you to buy so
    many things from Miss PENFOLD at the Bazaar. What are my
    father's noble lines?</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"True kindness is no blustering rogue that
            struts</p>

            <p>With empty mouthings on the stage of life,</p>

            <p>But, like a tender, timid plant that shuts</p>

            <p>At every touch, it shrinks from noisy strife."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>(And so forth, I've forgotten the rest.) "I love kindness,"
    continued Mrs. BELLAMY, "in young men. By the way, will you
    excuse a short invitation, and dine with us the day after
    to-morrow? All the PENFOLDS are coming." I said yes, and made
    up my mind that I must settle matters with MARY one way or
    another before complications got worse, or young PENFOLD made
    any more progress. I felt all the afternoon as if I'd committed
    a crime.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, June 13th</i>.&mdash;Three cheers. I've done it.
    Called on the BELLAMYS to-day. Found MARY alone. She was very
    sarcastic, but at last I could stand it no longer, and told her
    I had never loved and never should love anybody but her. Then
    she burst into tears, and I&mdash;anyhow she's promised to
    marry me. Have to interview Mrs. BELLAMY to-morrow. No time to
    do it to-day, as she was out till late. Chuck her up!</p>

    <p>Mother received the news very well. "Accepted you, my
    darling boy?" she said. "Of course she did. How <i>could</i>
    she do otherwise? Bring her to see me soon. She shall, of
    course, have all the family jewels immediately, and the
    dining-room furniture too. There'll be a few other trifles too,
    I daresay, that you'll be glad of." Dear Mother, she's the
    kindest soul in the world. <i>Carlo</i> has been informed of
    the news, and is said to have manifested an extraordinarily
    intelligent appreciation of it, by insisting on a second
    helping for supper. He's a remarkable dog.</p>

            refuse</p>

            <p>The dual gift. Our new Tithonus thou,</p>

            <p class="i2">On whom the indignant Hours work not
            their will,</p>

            <p>Seeing that, though old age may trench thy brow,</p>

            skill.</p>

            <p>Aurora's rosy shadows bathe thee yet,</p>

            <p class="i2">Nor coldy. "Give me immortality!"</p>

            <p>Tithonus cried, and lingered to regret</p>

            <p class="i2">The careless given boon. Not so with
            thee.</p>

            <p>Such immortality is thine as clings</p>

            die."</p>

            <p>The Singer lives on whilst the Song he sings</p>

            <p class="i2">Charms the world's heart. Such
            immortality</p>

            <p>Is better than unending lapse of years.</p>

            <p class="i2">For that the great god-gift, Eternal
            Youth,</p>

            <p>Accompanies it; the failures, the chill fears</p>

            <p class="i2">Tithonus knew thou may'st be spared in
            truth,</p>

            <p>Seeing that thine Aurora's quickening breath</p>

            <p class="i2">Lives in thee whilst thou livest, so that
            thou</p>

            <p>Needst neither dread nor pray for kindly Death,</p>

            <p class="i2">Like "that grey shadow once a man." And

    <h2>HOW TO SPEND A HOLIDAY ON SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Page from the Diary of an Enthusiast in search of
    Rest.</i>)</h4>

    <blockquote class="note">
        <p>["It is a good rule of practice to devote one portion of
        a short vacation to the serious and necessary business of
        doing nothing, and doing it very thoroughly
        too."&mdash;<i>Letter to the Times.</i>]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>At last my time for rest has arrived. Musn't be idle,
    though. Dr. MORTIMER GRANVILLE says it would be most injurious
    to my health. Must hunt up precedents for leisure leading to no
    results. Let me see&mdash;why not try the British Museum? Sure
    to find something useful there&mdash;and useless, which will be
    more appropriate.</p>

    <p>Take an omnibus. See one in the distance. Hail it. Conductor
    takes no notice! Shout and hurry after it. Try to attract
    attention of the driver. Failure. Capital commencement to my
    labours. Had my run for nothing!</p>

    <p>Victory! Stopped one partially occupied. No room outside.
    Enter interior. Six passengers on one seat. Five on the other.
    The half dozen regard me with contemptuous indifference. The
    five make no room. Explain that I want a seat. Remark received
    in silence. Sit down on knee of small boy. Mother (next him)
    expostulates&mdash;angrily. Chorus of indignant beholders.
    Conductor is impertinent. Ask for his number, he asks for my
    fare. Pay him. While this is going on, young woman has entered
    omnibus, and taken vacant seat. Conductor counts places, says
    there is no room. Can't carry me. Won't give back
    fare&mdash;has torn off ticket. Says I must get out. Say I will
    report him. Impudent again. Getting out drop ticket. Incident
    subsequently (to my later satisfaction) leads to nothing!</p>

    <p>Won't have anything more to do with the omnibuses. Enter
    hansom&mdash;old man (the driver) smiles civilly when I say
    "British Museum." Now, I must seriously rest. Go to sleep.
    Slumber until awakened by a jolt. Look out. Find myself near
    the river. Strikes me that the Thames is not close to the
    Museum. Appeal to cabman through the hole in the roof.
    Difficulty in attracting his attention. Stop him at last. Ask
    him why he did not take me to the Museum. He smiles and says he
    didn't hear me&mdash;he is deaf! Very angry. He expostulates,
    civilly. He saw I was asleep and didn't wish to disturb me! He
    has been driving up and down the Thames Embankment for the last
    three hours&mdash;charge seven and sixpence. Don't see my way
    out of the difficulty, except by payment. He thanks me, and
    suggests that he shall now drive me to the Museum for
    eighteen-pence. Very angry and refuse. He is hailed by someone
    else, and is off to pick up his new fare. On consideration it
    seems to me that my anger has led to nothing.
    Nothing&mdash;just what I wanted, but not exactly at the right
    moment.</p>

    <p>Rather hungry. Enter a restaurant. Crowded with gentlemen
    wearing hats&mdash;who seem to be on intimate terms with the
    waiters. Get a bill of fare which is thrust into my hands by an
    attendant loaded with dishes. Let me see&mdash;what shall I
    have? "Lamb's head and peas." Have never tried this dish. Might
    be good. Waiter (who seems to be revolving, like the planetary
    system, in an orbit) reaches me, and I shout what I want. He
    replies, "Sorry, Sir, just off," and vanishes. Look up
    something else. "Liver and bacon." Not had it for years! Used
    to like it. On reappearance of the planetary waiter, give my
    order. He nods and vanishes. Wait patiently. Rather annoyed
    that my nearest neighbour has used my part of the table for a
    dish containing broad beans. Glare at him. No result. Planetary
    waiter has passed me twice&mdash;stop him angrily the third
    time. He is less busy now&mdash;he pauses. He thrusts bill of
    fare before me, and asks me "what I would please to want."
    Explode and shout in tones of thunder, "Liver and bacon!" He
    disappears, and comes back a few minutes later, saying, "Very
    sorry, but when I first ordered it, liver and bacon <i>was</i>
    on&mdash;now it's off. Will I have a chop?" Reply angrily,
    "No." Same answer to "Steak," "Duck and green peas," "A cut off
    the beef joint," and "Irish stew." Waiter asks (with forced
    civility), "What <i>will</i> I have!" I return, as I leave the
    restaurant, "Nothing!" On regaining the street (although
    hungry) I am pleased to think that I am still obeying Dr.
    MORTIMER GRANVILLE's directions!</p>

    <p>No use trying cab or omnibus. Both failures. Why not walk?
    Good way of wasting time, so begin to go northward, and in due
    course get to Bloomsbury. Enter Museum. Umbrella seized.
    Approach Reading Room. Civil attendant informs me that the
    Library is closed&mdash;taking stock, or something! Then I have
    come all this way for nothing! Angry, but inwardly contented.
    Doing nothing "very thoroughly!"</p>

        <a href="images/77-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/77-2.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Turn back. Why not go to a theatre? Certainly. Go to four in
    succession, and find them all closed! Well, good way of wasting
    time, Shall I visit one of the Exhibitions? Chelsea or Earl's
    Court? After consideration, come to the conclusion that this
    would be worse than doing nothing. Must draw the line
    somewhere!</p>

    <p>After all, there is no place like home. Or shall I go to my
    Club? Yes. Get there. Find it is being repaired, and that the
    members are taken in somewhere else. Hate new scenes and new
    faces. Return to my first idea, and make for my private
    address; but feel that it may be rather dull, as my wife and
    the children are at the seaside. Still, somebody can get me a
    little supper. At least, I hope so. Find my latch-key is of no
    use, on account of the chain being up. Ring angrily, when a
    charwoman in a bonnet appears, and explains that the servants,
    not expecting me home so early, have gone to the play, having
    locked up the larder. Charwoman agrees with me that it is
    disgraceful&mdash;especially the locking up of the larder.</p>

    <p>However, it can't be helped. Make up my mind to go to bed,
    and get fast asleep, thoroughly tired out with the labours of a
    day spent in doing absolutely nothing! Hope (in my dreams) that
    Dr. MORTIMER GRANVILLE will be satisfied!</p>

    <p>A NOTE.&mdash;In <i>Black and White</i> for August 8 there
    is a large picture representing a group of English Dramatists,
    amongst whom please specially notice a figure intended for Mr.
    W.S. GILBERT (it was thoughtful and kind of the artist to put
    the names below), who is apparently explaining to a select few
    why he has been compelled to come out in this strange old coat
    and these queer collars. All the Dramatists look as cheerful as
    mutes at a funeral, their troubled expression of countenance
    probably arising from the knowledge that somewhere hidden away
    is a certain eminently unbiassed Ibsenitish critic who has been
    engaged to do the lot in a lump. From this exhibition of

    <p><i>Question</i>. I think you have been to the Royal Naval
    Exhibition at Chelsea.</p>

    <p><i>Answer</i>. I have. I was induced to make the journey by
    an advertising placard posted on two official boards outside
    the Admiralty.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> What was your first impression on reaching the
    grounds usually open to the public, but now reserved for
    commercial purposes?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> That the Public were extremely benevolent to
    permit so long an infringement of their right of way and other
    privileges.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> After you had entered the Exhibition, what was
    your initial impression?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> That a great number of the exhibits were not very
    appropriate advertisements.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> Did you see Seamen of the Royal Navy making an
    exhibition of themselves in the Arena?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> I did; and could not help contrasting with the
    feebly-histrionic display the recent order in Paris forbidding
    the French soldiers to take part in theatrical
    representations.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> Was the display of these seamen of the Royal Navy
    particularly impressive?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> No, and I fancy that some of the audience who had
    paid an extra sixpence to see it from the Grand Stand, were
    slightly disappointed.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> Besides the cutlass and gun drill, did you see
    these seamen (wearing Her Majesty's uniform), take part in any
    other performance?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> I did, and for this, too, an extra sixpence was
    charged for the use of the Grand Stand. They waded about in a
    sort of tank or large bath with models of ironclads on their
    heads.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> So far as you could see was this last display
    conducive to the maintenance of strict discipline?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> I should say not, the more especially as I noticed
    towards the close of the display that the men seemed inclined
    to indulge in larking.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> Has this raree show caused you to wish to enlist
    in the Royal Navy?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> Certainly not. The gun and cutlass drill before a
    paying audience reminded me of <i>The Battle of Waterloo</i> at
    Astley's.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> But would you not like to join the Royal Navy, so
    that you might be qualified to perform in a tank?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> No; for on consideration I think if I wished to do
    anything in the "comic water-tournament line," I could make
    better terms with Mr. SANGER than the Lords of the
    Admiralty.</p>

    <p>Begin to regret dinners on board the <i>Grantully
    Castle</i>. The other day was regretting the Amphitryon. Don't
    go so far back as the Albemarle-Street Amphitryon, quite
    satisfied with a simple Donald Currie. [<i>Mem.</i>&mdash;The
    proverb hath much truth in it that saith, "Go farther and fare
    worse."] Sick of chicken. With poetic epigrammacy might say,
    "Quite sick Of chick." Stringy chickens, too! One has to tug at
    them; sort of game of "poulet-hauly"&mdash;as DRUMMY would say.
    Though were he here, I doubt if he would say anything. He
    certainly would eat nothing: probably would only open his mouth
    to observe, "I'm off!" and then we should see him no more.
    Quite right. So would I&mdash;but for "my oath, my Lord, my
    oath!" (N.B.&mdash;This is a quotation. Sure of it. Where from?
    Don't know. Tragedy probably; sounds tragic. No matter. Can
    give it with effect in a speech, and Members turn to one
    another and ask, "What's that from?" When they ask me
    confidentially afterwards, I reply with an air of intense
    surprise, "What! don't <i>you</i> know! Well!!" and I turn on
    my heel, leaving CHUCKLEHEAD, M.P., annoyed with
    himself,&mdash;"<i>planté là</i>" as DRUMMY would
    say,&mdash;for being so ignorant, and for having displayed his
    ignorance so palpably. Off he goes to British Museum and
    searches for quotation. This gives him opportunity of acquiring
    much useful knowledge, which, but for me, he would not have
    had. Rather a long parenthesis this. So&mdash;on we goes
    again.)</p>

    <h4>TO THE MINES.</h4>

    <p><i>À propos</i> of exploring, the other day, a digger's
    assistant came up to me and inquired "If I had," as I
    understood him, "my gin pack'd." I returned that I never took
    spirits. Found out subsequently that word was spelt
    "<i>mijinpacht</i>," which is African-Dutch for "lease." Well,
    why didn't he say so before? Of course I have, and plenty of
    'em; else why am I here?</p>

    <p>To-day went to see the ore in the Robinson Crusoe Mines. As
    D.W. would say, "The site strikes me with ore!"</p>

    <p>Much interested, of course, in inspecting the Salisbury
    Mine. Naturally, I put in my claim for the Salisbury. What's in
    a name and a family, if one can't get some good out of 'em?
    Intend to start the "Uncle Mine." Fine chance. Any place where
    there's a large and fluctuating Pop-ulation (with emphasis on
    the "Pop"), the Uncle Mine is a certainty." But Oh, for the
    "pop,"&mdash;I mean the dear old fizz,&mdash;and the older it
    is, the dearer it is,&mdash;at the Amphitryon.</p>

    <h4>"IS LIFE WORTH LIVING?"</h4>

    <p>The Transvaal's the place for living in. Here life is life,
    be it never so lively. The only nuisance is the Boer; and the
    Boer's a hass, or rather a mule. That's my opinion of Boers
    individually and collectively; I make no concessions to them;
    hang 'em, they've already got enough. If this country had been
    in the hands of Englishmen, or Americans, or both jointly
    (talking of jointly, we'd have had better dinners than we get
    now but of this anon&mdash;) with a certain person whom I can
    mention, and who is not a hundred miles distant from the
    present writer at this moment, as Head of affairs, an Imperial
    ruler, with power to add to his number (which number would be
    One, and would remain so), then this country, in a very short
    time, would have ruled the world. What ports, what champagnes,
    what railroads, what shipping, what commerce, what an Imperial
    Parliament, with the Despot in the Chair in both Houses, all
    speeches, except the Despot's, limited to five minutes apiece,
    and no reduction on talking a quantity. Oh, for one hour of
    this power, and the Amphitryon be blowed! Aha! <i>Grandolphus
    Africanus Protector</i> to begin with; <i>Grandolphus Africanus
    Rex</i> to go on with; and <i>Grandolphus Africanissimmus
    Imperator</i> to finish with!</p>

    <p>Now to dinner! On what? Yah! tough beef, woolly mutton and
    stringy chicken. And to think that but for the Boers, the
    beastly Boers, we should have had the finest teal, wild duck,
    venison, goslings, asparagus, French beans, best Welsh mutton,
    and real turtle soup every day <i>au choix</i>!! But what did
    the Boers do? Why, they ascertained that skins and feathers,
    and shells, were valuable, whereupon they went to work, shot
    everything everywhere, sold skins and feathers, and shells! So
    that deer and birds hadn't a chance. If they popped out, pop
    went the guns like the original weasel, which some years ago
    was always popping, and the poor dumb animals with the pleading
    eyes and the tender flesh were slaughtered wholesale. In this
    manner, too, the game soon came to an end, as it must do
    whenever the game is so one-sided as it was here. Then, as I
    have said, the shells were valuable! The shells! What chance
    had the tortoise and the turtle? "'Tis the voice of the turtle,
    I heard him complain." (What's that from? That's from
    WATTS&mdash;eh?) What chance had the peas, however wild? or a
    bean as broad as one of &mdash;&mdash;'s after-dinner stories?
    Ah! it makes me sad and angry, and once again I cry Oh, for an
    hour, and that the dinner-hour, aboard the <i>Grantully
    Castle</i>! Ay! even though the G.O.M. were on board; for he
    could appreciate the daily Currie which to me is now
    <i>perdu</i>. Well! so to dinner "with what appetite I may,"
    and then on to Pretoria, of which place I think I shall change
    the name to Pre-radicallia or Pre-fourthpartia. You see
    Pre-toria implies one who was Toryer than a Tory. Aha! what is
    my scheme? Do you see the picture? GRANDOLPHUS IMPERATOR REX
    AURIFERORUM MEORUM (Latiné for "Mines") surrounded by his

    that he used his drumsticks in such a manner as in a little
    more would have brought flocks of other furious wild turkeys on
    to the scene, had I not, with great presence of mind and one
    small bullet <span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"
       id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span> out of my spring-pea rifle
       managed to crack the parchment-like skin which covers his
       drum, and at the same time broken one of his sticks. Then,
       he fell. Carried him home on my back. What larks! Killed
       four-and-twenty blackbirds at one shot as they were all
       sitting in a row on a rail. They were so frightened of me,
       <i>it made 'em quail!!</i> Wonderful transformation, wasn't
       it? But fact, all the same. Four-and-twenty quail All on a
       rail. Killed eighty "Koran," a Mahomedan bird, very scarce,
       and therefore bring in a considerable Mahomet, or, (ahem)
       profit? See? Shot a "Tittup"&mdash;so called on account of
       its peculiar action after drinking; also three early German
       Beerbirds, or, as the Dutchmen call them, "Spring-boks."
       There is another origin for this name, which is also likely,
       and that is that they don't appear when there's an early
       spring, but when the spring is rather backward then they
       come forward. Whichever you like, my little dear, you pays

    <p><i>Short Papers in Magazines</i>.&mdash;"A starry night Is
    the shepherd's delight," and as this sort of night is to the
    pastor, so are short stories in Monthly Magazines to the Baron.
    Moreover, his recommendation of them is, as he knows from
    numerous grateful Correspondents, "a boon and a blessing" to
    such as follow his lead. He owns to a partiality for the weird,
    and if he can come across a brief "curdler," he at once singles
    it out for the delectation of those whose taste is in the same
    direction. But no curdler has he come across for some
    considerable time; but for short essays and tales to be read by
    ladies in some quiet half-hour before toiletting or
    untoiletting, or by the weaker sex in the smoking-room, the
    Baron begs to commend "THACKERAY's Portraits of Himself," as
    interesting to Thackerayans, and "A Maiden Speech," in
    <i>Murray</i>, for August, the latter being rather too sketchy,
    though in its sketchiness artistic, as, like <i>Sam
    Weller's</i> love-letter, it makes you "wish as there was more
    of it."</p>

    <p>Commended also by the Baron are "The Story of a Violin," by
    ERNEST DOWSON, and "Heera Nund," by F.A. STEEL, in
    <i>Macmillan</i>. If "A First Family of Tasajara" is continued
    as well as it is commenced in the same above-mentioned
    Mac-azine, it will be about as good a tale as BRET HARTE has
    ever written, and that is saying a good deal, mind you.</p>

    <p>Unfinished Stories&mdash;that is, Stories finished in style,
    yet, as another contradiction in terms, short stories without
    any end, are rather the vogue nowadays in Magazines. Let me
    recommend as specimens "Francesca's Revenge" in
    <i>Blackwood</i>, and "Disillusioned" in <i>London
    Society</i>.</p>

    <p>Don't tell the Baron that these hints are unappreciated. He
    knows better. He can produce letters imploring him to read and
    notice, letters asking him what to read, and letters
    complaining that his advice is not more frequently given. Aware
    of this responsibility, he never recommends what he has not
    himself read, or what some trusted partner in the Firm of BARON
    DE BOOK-WORMS &amp; Co. has not read for him. <i>Verb.

    <h2>MISS DECIMA-HELYETT-SMITHSON-JACKSON.</h2>

    <p>One or two of the especially well-informed dramatic critics
    who, of course, had seen the original piece <i>Miss Helyett</i>
    in Paris, asked why the English adapter had taken the trouble
    to invent nine sisters for the heroine; the nine sisters never
    being seen and having nothing whatever to do with the plot.
    Here the well-informed ones were to a certain extent wrong. In
    the original French piece, <i>Miss Helyett</i>,&mdash;whose
    name, as is suggested by <i>Woman</i>, is evidently a French
    rendering for "Miss ELLIOT," which M. BOUCHERON "concluded was
    her Christian name"&mdash;speaking of herself, says to her
    father, "<i>Vous savez bien, mon père, que vous n'avez pas de
    plus grande admiratrice que votre onzième enfant.</i>" And the
    Reverend SMITHSON tells her, a little later, "<i>J'ai casé
    toutes tes soeurs très jeunes</i>&mdash;" and "<i>Je ne devrais
    pourtant pas avoir de peine à trouver un onzième
    gendre.</i>"</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:20%;">
        <a href="images/84-3.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/84-3.png"
             alt="'Oh, shocking!!'" /></a>"Oh, shocking!!"
    </div>

    <p>That is why he is travelling to get an "<i>onzième
    gendre</i>" for his "<i>onzième enfant</i>." The English
    adapter relieved Mr. SMITHSON of one of his family, and so
    <i>Miss Helyett Smithson</i> became <i>Miss Decima Jackson</i>,
    <i>i.e.</i>, the tenth, instead of the eleventh, of the worthy
    pastor's family. The fact that all her sisters are married,
    makes single unblessedness a reproach to her. No sort of
    purpose would have been served by such a wholesale massacre of
    innocents as the extinction of all <i>Pastor Smithson's</i>,
    alias <i>Jackson's</i>, ten "pretty chicks at one fell
    swoop."</p>

    <p>Miss NESVILLE, the foreign representative of <i>Miss
    Decima</i> at the Criterion, is uncommonly childlike and bland;
    moreover, she sings charmingly; while of Mr. DAVID JAMES as the
    pastor <i>Jackson</i> it may be said, "Sure such a <i>père</i>
    was never seen!" The Irishman, Mr. CHAUNCEY OLCOTT, has a
    mighty purty voice, and gains a hearty <i>encore</i> for a
    ditty of which the music is not particularly striking. Mr.
    PERCY REEVE has written words which go glibly to AUDRAN's
    music, and fit the situations. The piece is capitally played
    and sung all round; and marvellous is Miss VICTOR as the
    Spanish mother. The <i>mise-en-scène</i> is far better here
    than it is in Paris, where this "musical-comedy" is still an
    attraction.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
